        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Gaurav Kaila!</h1>
				<p> I work as an artificial intelligence and analytics analyst in the Centre for Innovation at Accenture Dublin. The centre is an an
			exciting new concept where people from diverse educational and cultural backgrounds come together to solve some of the most challenging problems 
					we face today. Comprising primarily of four pillars:</p>
			<p>1. AI and Analytics</p>
			<p>2. Software Engineering</p>
			<p>3. Technology Labs</p>
			<p>4. Innovation Experience and Design</p>
			<p>...that work collaboratively to refine problem statements, research the state-of-the-art, develop novel solutions and prototype in a progressive and efficient 
			environment.As part of the AI and Analytics team, I work in the domain of image and video analytics.
			<p> My daily work includes working with cutting edge machine learning and deep learning technology to advance object classification , facial recognition and 
			scene description. My research interests include 
				- Public Safety:  Eg. Development of advanced machine learning and analytics systems for optimally utilizing vast amount of real time video and image feed. 
				- Healthcare: Eg. Application of deep neural nets to medical images for diseased/non-diseased classfication. </p>
			<p> If the above topics interest you or any topic you think might interest me, drop in a mail. </p>
